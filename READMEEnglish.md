Web Scraping
This project is a web scraper application developed to find retail sock sellers in specific countries, such as Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and extract contact information from their websites. Businesses are found using the Google Places API, and contact details and email addresses are extracted from the websites. The reason for using Google API is to ensure that everything is legal. In this project, by entering specific keywords and countries, when searching in the search engine for those countries, contact information is retrieved from the pages that appear. The basic idea is to consider the contact details shared on the website of a global company; these details are easily accessible to everyone. The goal is to find this information quickly and systematically, not manually, but automatically.

Features:

Multiple Country Support
Advanced Keyword Search: Relevant businesses are searched using country-specific keywords.
CSV Output: The collected data is saved into a CSV file.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
requests, beautifulsoup4, and urllib3 libraries.
